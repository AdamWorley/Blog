Unless you have been living under a rock you have almost certainly come across an article or news headline about [OpenAIs ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) or one of it's competitors [Googles Bard](https://bard.google.com/) or [Microsoft's Bing chat bot](https://www.bing.com/) (Only available through Edge at the time of writing).

The first one out the door and arguably the most mature and useful is  and so is the one that I will mainly be talking about, the same principals apply generally to the other tools as well.

Here's ChatGPTs welcoming message for the prompt 'Could you say hi to the readers of my blog called "wordley blog"':
> Hello readers of Wordley Blog! This is ChatGPT, a language model here to say hi and welcome you to the blog. I hope you enjoy your time here and find the content informative and engaging.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT in the simplest terms is predictive text turned up to 11! It has been trained on a huge dataset of written content from various sources and through a learning process where it had been trained on what makes for a good response is able to take a written prompt and is able to respond in a natural way with a generally high level of accuracy.

## What is it Good For?

Being a fairly general language AI it can be used for all sorts of things;

### if you're a content creator it can provide content ideas

*I may use some of these*

### help with writing code

There are other tools more specialised for this such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/) or more recently [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/).

### A rubber duck or something to bounce ideas off of

## Is this the Future?

From the examples above I hope you can see how powerful something like this can be and how we can harness them to improve our productivity and provide ideas that we can continue to develop.

It can be used to provide a useful summary of a large body of text or even provide a simplified explanation which could be hugely beneficial not just to people who are busy and want to see if something is worth reading in more detail, but also more importantly to those who may have some form of cognitive impairment that might struggle to comprehend the original content, even taking in a sprawl of terms and conditions that we all blindly accept and crunching them down into something that we might actually read (probably not, but still!).

Within a short space of time ChatGPT has been upgraded to a newer version of it's language model (GPT-3 to GTP-4) which came with improvements to it's responses, it now also has the ability to have plugins enable that allow it to query other data sources such as [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) that give it enhanced abilities to perform calculations or even render charts to provide a more visual response to it's queries. Similarly Bard and Bing Chat have access to the internet, allowing them to search pretty much anything to fill in gaps in the data set they have been trained on.

With all of this in mind I think it's safe to say that we have reached another milestone in progress towards an AI future, but is that a good thing?

## Should I Be Worried?

There has been some concerning reports around Bing chat becoming [*unhinged*](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23599072/microsoft-ai-bing-personality-conversations-spy-employees-webcams) and even that [the ethics team at Microsoft have been let go](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/13/microsoft-lays-off-an-ethical-ai-team-as-it-doubles-down-on-openai/), 

## If it Bleeds

It is not however perfect, as it's mostly been trained on English documents it's abilities to communicate in other languages is quite limited. It also is not
