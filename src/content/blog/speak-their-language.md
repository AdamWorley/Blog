Phrase things in away that the person you're talking to will not just understand (though that's always a good start) but will also be able to get on board with e.g. "We have a bunch of tech-debt we need to fix before we work on the next feature" vs "We're going to make this service faster and fix the issue X that our users have before we take on the next feature".

The same way that shouting "I want a hamburger!" to someone who can't understand what you're saying will probably not end up with you getting a hamburger; you can't *just* repeat the same technical phrase to someone in the business and get them to understand you.
