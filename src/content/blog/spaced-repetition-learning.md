When it comes to learning new things it can be easy to become overwhelmed with the amount of information that you'll need to take in, and I don't know about you but I'm kind of lazy and I'd rather not spend multiple hours trawling through material to find I don't remember anything from the start when I reach the end. So the two main issues I find are;

- How much should I learn?
- How can I remember it all?

I'm going to start by addressing the 2nd point as that's exactly what Spaced Repetition Learning (SRS) is great for, and I'm hoping that by the end of this post you'll be converted (or at least interested enough to look more into it).

## How can I remember it all?

There's not much point in going through trying to learn something if you can't retain it, a common way to learn new things is by going over it multiple times in the hope that it will sink in a little bit more each time.

Most people would use flash cards or something similar for this kind of revision, this works OK for smaller amounts of information but becomes increasingly less practical as you try to going over more as the time it takes to revise becomes unmanageable and usually quite daunting and if you're anything like me you'd rather be doing anything else.

Here enters SRS! Instead of going over an entire deck of flashcards or a mound of notes every time, SRS breaks down your revision into more manageable sessions by surfacing only the information you're about to forget.

### Connecting the Dots

Many studies show that you're more likely to learn things when it's not as easy, it's common to fall into the trap of feeling like you're learning because you're churning through a load of information, but in reality you're not helping yourself much and just getting some endorphin's from *doing* not learning [1].

When you try to remember something that is almost out of reach your brain works hard to create the connections to be able to recall the information you're looking for and in general the more connections or paths your brain has available to more likely you are to remember what it is you're trying to recall.

Combining the power of recalling information as it's about to be forgotten with the frequency that makes SRS work so well vs binge revision sessions is what also leads to those moments of Eureka! Like the solution to something that you have been working on coming to you so clearly when you're in the shower or just out at the supermarket and your brain is subconsciously still working on it, our brains are pattern matching machines that just don't stop. 

### Getting Practical With Anki

I'm going to recommend [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) which is a free (except for iOS) app that implements SRS flashcards, you can create your own cards easily or if you're really lazy (like me) there's a huge selection of [decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) that other people have shared! Though it should be said that the process of creating the Anki cards is also an excellent way to start remembering what it is you're trying to learn.

For a simple example let's say you're trying to remember the 100 most common phrases in Spanish, you would have a deck with 100 cards that has the Spanish Phrase on one side and the English on the other.

On day one 5 random cards from the deck are used for the session and you'll go through them one at a time. Let's say you're starting off seeing the Spanish side and trying to get the English answer, once you reveal the answer you'll be given 4 options;

- **Again** - marks your answer as incorrect and asks Anki to show the card more frequently in the future.
- **Hard** - by default, shows the card at a slightly longer delay than last time, and tells Anki to show the card more frequently in the future.
- **Good** - tells Anki that the last delay was about right
- **Easy** - tells Anki to show you the card less often

Day 2 you'll be drawn another 5 random cards from the deck along with any you struggled with on day 1 will also be shown and you'll go through the same process as before.

As you continue through the days as some new cards from the deck are brought in and you revise cards from previous days that the Anki algorithm predicts you're about to forget, on average you might have 15 cards to revise and it might take about 1 minute per card so you'll only be revising for 15 minutes a day! Which seems like a manageable amount of time for most people.

And as time goes on and you find cards easier to answer you'll have fewer cards as you continue with Anki only showing the cards you're about to forget.

## SRS For the Win

Overall, spaced repetition is a powerful tool for improving long-term retention of knowledge and should be considered by anyone looking to maximize their learning potential. Whether you are a student preparing for exams, a language learner trying to master a new vocabulary, or simply someone looking to improve your retention of new information, spaced repetition can help you achieve your learning goals.
