Bullet journaling is a method of keeping track of your daily tasks, appointments, and goals in a journal that you create yourself. It's a simple and effective way to stay organized and focused, and can be customized to fit your individual needs and preferences. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of bullet journaling and how to get started.

If you're anything like me and have tried different to-do apps, calendars and note-taking tools and find that none of them seem to stick, then I would highly recommend giving Bullet journaling a go!

## What is Bullet Journaling?

Bullet journaling, also known as BuJo, is a method of organizing your life using a journal. It was created by Ryder Carroll, who developed a system that can be customized to fit individual needs. The basic idea is to use a notebook to create a planner, to-do list, diary, and more all in one place.

The beauty of bullet journaling is that you can tailor it to suit your specific needs. You can add sections for tracking habits, exercise, meal planning, and more. You can also add pages for notes, sketches, and reflections. Bullet journaling is a versatile system that can be adapted to your lifestyle.

## Getting Started with Bullet Journaling

To get started with bullet journaling, you'll need a notebook and a pen or pencil. Any notebook will work, but many people prefer to use a notebook with dotted or grid paper. This allows for more flexibility in creating layouts and designs, my preference is dotted grid paper as the dots provide enough of a guide to write in straight lines and also helps when drawing straight lines for tables or to have a horizontal rule to break things up.

Feel free to start with any spare notebook you might have so you can get started and have a feel for doing bullet journaling without any kind of upfront cost. There is however something nice about the tactility of a nice notebook and pen which can make the experience a bit more *special* in an almost meditative way, instead of potentially feeling like a chore.

Once you have your notebook, it's time to start setting it up. The first step is to create an index. This is a table of contents for your bullet journal that will help you keep track of where everything is located. You'll also want to number your pages as you go. This sounds like more work than it actually is and shouldn't take longer than a few minutes.

Next, create a future log. This is a place to record upcoming events and tasks for the next six months or so. You can use a calendar layout or a list format, depending on your preference.

After your future log, create a monthly log. This is where you'll record all the tasks and events for the current month. You can use a calendar layout, a list format, or a combination of both.

Finally, create a daily log. This is where you'll record your daily tasks, appointments, and notes. You can use bullet points, symbols, and colors to organize your tasks and make them more visually appealing.

### Recommended Kit

You can start with pretty much any notebook you have to hand, however I would recommend the [LEUCHTTURM1917 Notebook*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/LEUCHTTURM1917-329398-Notebook-Medium-numbered/dp/B00SBDN14K?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=&linkId=220e464ada94b70be4f5ebb6dbfb0f71&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) it has numbered pages that make using the index quicker than numbering the pages yourself, has a couple ribbon bookmarks that makes it easier to pick keep track of a couple of pages to get around your notebook quicker and it also has dotted pages which I find give the right amount of guidance so I don't end up writing diagonally across the page.

As a lefty I struggle to find good pens that don't smudge and won't bleed through the pages, but I have found either; [ARTEZA Fineliner Pens*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ARTEZA-Fineliner-Point-Markers-Black/dp/B078SFWNSP?crid=6LK5T43FKKCZ&keywords=arteza+pen&qid=1680260447&s=officeproduct&sprefix=arteza+pen%2Coffice-products%2C53&sr=1-7&linkCode=ll1&tag=mada360-21&linkId=107de22e34793948a3c388f8db9a1321&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), or a fine point sharpie work welland dry quickly.

I would advise against using an erasable pen or pencil as being able to see notes that you have stricken off can be helpful and allow you to see your thought process.

## Customizing Your Bullet Journal

One of the best things about bullet journaling is that you can customize it to fit your individual needs. You can add sections for tracking habits, exercise, meal planning, and more. You can also add pages for notes, sketches, and reflections (be a real life [Nathan Drake](https://www.eurogamer.net/drakes-top-journal-entries-according-to-the-uncharted-4-artist-who-drew-them) or [Arthur Morgan](https://preview.redd.it/4sgmrkloie131.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8aef86509d54588b1a0f698569c70a64179ef26c)).

To customize your bullet journal, start by identifying the areas of your life that you want to focus on. Do you want to track your exercise routine? Are you trying to develop a daily meditation practice? Once you have a list of areas you want to focus on, you can create sections in your bullet journal to track your progress. It can be useful to track habits in you daily log by using a simple key and marking off your habits as you go.

You can also get creative with your layouts and designs. Use different colors, fonts, and symbols to make your bullet journal visually appealing. You can create doodles, sketches, and hand-lettering to make your pages unique.

### Down the Rabbit Hole

I will give a warning that if you look into how other people use and personalise their journals you might get BuJo envy or start getting distracted with fancy colours, doodles and writing styles, of course make your BuJo your own and customise it and have some fun, but be careful not to end up using it as more of a doodle book than a management tool!

## Tips for Success with Bullet Journaling

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your bullet journal:

1. Keep it simple. Bullet journaling is meant to be a simple and effective system for staying organized. Don't get bogged down in complicated layouts or designs.

2. Be consistent. Make it a habit to use your bullet journal every day. This will help you stay on top of your tasks and goals.

3. Use symbols and shorthand. Symbols like dots, circles, and squares can help you quickly identify tasks and events. Use shorthand like "M" for meetings and "T" for tasks to save time.

4. Don't be afraid to experiment. Bullet journaling is a flexible system that can be customized to fit you're style and needs.
