Learning to say "no" isn't just a way of trying to be awkward for other people, it's an important way of protecting your own sanity and avoid being overloaded by tasks and responsibilites that other's are asking of you.

By being a "yes-man" you're inavertantly bringing more stress your way, it's kind of like an old HSBC advert where in China clearing your plate is a sign

## Be less blunt

But don't give an out

e.g. "No I can't do that today", "No I don't think that's possible, but I can look into it if needed".

## Ask for something from them
